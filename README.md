## ðŸ”§ Flutter Version Management (FVM)

This project uses [FVM](https://fvm.app/) to pin the Flutter SDK version, ensuring consistency across all contributors and CI/CD.

# Project Name

This Flutter project uses **[FVM (Flutter Version Management)](https://fvm.app/)** to ensure all contributors and CI/CD pipelines use the exact same Flutter and Dart versions.

### Setup

Install the pinned Flutter version:

```bash
fvm install
```

This will install the version defined in .fvmrc and create a local symlink under .fvm/.

### Usage

Run all Flutter/Dart commands through FVM to ensure consistency:

```bash
fvm flutter pub get
fvm flutter run
fvm flutter test
fvm dart format .
fvm dart run tool/some_script.dart
```

In IDEs (VS Code, Android Studio, IntelliJ), point the Flutter SDK path to:

```
<project>/.fvm/flutter_sdk
```

After this, IDE buttons like Pub get, Run, and Test will use the FVM-managed SDK.

### CI/CD

Example GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
name: Flutter CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: macos-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - uses: actions/cache@v4
        with:
          path: ~/.fvm
          key: fvm-${{ runner.os }}-${{ hashFiles('**/.fvm/fvm_config.json') }}

      - name: Install FVM
        run: |
          brew tap leoafarias/fvm
          brew install fvm

      - name: Setup Flutter
        run: |
          fvm install
          fvm flutter --version

      - name: Get dependencies & run tests
        run: |
          fvm flutter pub get
          fvm flutter test
```

### Verification

To confirm youâ€™re using the right SDK:

```bash
fvm flutter doctor
```

The SDK path should point inside your ~/.fvm/versions/ directory.

### Version Control
âœ… Commit .fvmrc (the source of truth for the Flutter version).
ðŸš« Ignore .fvm/ (local SDK files, caches, and symlinks).

Note for legacy projects (FVM v2 and below):
Older versions used .fvm/fvm_config.json instead of .fvmrc. If you are maintaining such a project, commit fvm_config.json instead, and add an exception rule to your .gitignore (see below).
